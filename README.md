# SNN

Neuron.py contains three two different neurons

- input neuron
- LIF (for hidden layer and output layer)

and ugly code to show the output and potential for each layer

output neuron is not correct yet.



SNN.py builds Spiking Neuron Network, still under construction



Synapse.py shows how signal pass from one neuron to another according to PSP, basiclly add a $\alpha$-function when a spike fires.
